### Creating columns

    For the longest time, we had to use something called floats to
    make block level elements go next to one another.

    It involved things sliding under each other and clears. It was
    not fun.

    Then we finally got something called flexbox. Itâ€™s a bit of a
    strange name, but it was our first layout tool.

    By default, when setting display: flex on a element, all the
    children will become columns.
